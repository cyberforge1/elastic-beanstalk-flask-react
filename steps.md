# STEPS


*** run flask and react application under the nginx and gunicorn servers locally first

** create configuration files, build and bundle for frontend/backend

1) package flask app and add files (procfile, gunicorn?)
2) build react app for production
3) create terraform environment (s3, elastic beanstalk, etc.)
4) create a script that automates building of application and terraform provisioning
